# Ice bathing
## Why?
* Best training I know of for stepping outside your comfort zone. Only problem is it gets easier each time. So the first time is the real training.
* It's also good for your immune system and health.

## Mental tricks
1. Ice cold water is never colder than -1 degrees
2. If you get properly cold water in your house, it will be 4 degrees. I.e. if you've ever taken a cold shower, it will only be around 4 degrees colder than that. That's nothing.
3. Water looks a lot colder in winter, but if you've ever taken a bath early spring while there is still ice on the lake, then that has basically the same tempreature.
4. It will be uncomfortable, but that is just your body's instinct to survive. But that's the thing. You have built in instincts for surviving _exactly this_ scenario.
5. Can you stommich touching ice? Ice is colder than liquid water. Don't fret.
6. YOU'RE A FUCKING VIKING. HURRRR.

## Practicalities
* The secret is to be warm before you jump in. That's the most important bit. Jumping jacks, burpees, squats and pushups are your friend.
* Car or fireplace is nice to have nearby.

## What you need
* A spotter aka friend, or an enemy
* A rope
* A saw, an axe, ice drill and/or a chainsaw
* Warm (wool) clothes
* Waterproof shoes and pants.
